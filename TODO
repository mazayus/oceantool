* Validate ocean parameters (it just throws an assertion error on non-power-of-2 grid sizes right now).
* More accurate normal map calculation. Take the gradient of the Fourier Series and run IDFT on it?
* The SSE code is a direct translation of the scalar code. Can we do better?
* Remove unused code (this project was extracted from one of my other projects).
* Generating the ocean spectrum takes longer than performing the IDFT.
* Wide random numbers (uniform and normal distributions).
* Wide mathematical functions (sine/cosine and complex exponential).
* Avoid unaligned loads/stores? Does it even matter anymore?
* Threading.
* Single-precision IDFT.
* AVX.
